test1:

Yes.
2.5.3.8.9.

test2:

Yes.
1.11.14.5.12.7.9.15.18

test3:

No.

It will cause a compile error.

EA must be declared in the test method.
EB is an unchecked exception (Runtime Exception) and does not need to be declared in the test method
(Although program will actually throw EB instead of EA).

Change: add "throws EA" after "public void test3()".
